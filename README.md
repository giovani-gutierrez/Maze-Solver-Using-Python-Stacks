# Maze-Solver-Using-Python-Stacks
We can explore and solve a maze by utilizing a Stack data structure. The idea is given coordinates (x,y positions), we can explore in certain directions until we reach dead ends or our goal. If we do reach a dead end, a Stack data structure can help us keep track of coordinates we’ve visited and allow us to “backtrack” to a certain point.
